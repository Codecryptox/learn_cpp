# The complete C++ compilation Process goes through these steps : Source Code  --> Compiler --> Linker --> Executable

## 1. Compiler
To compile the C++ code we use the C++ compiler
It does two task : 1. check the source code (.cpp file) for any error and compiles the Source code into the Object file.
It will throw a compilation error if the source code is not correct.
e.g  age_calculator.cpp  --->  age_calculator.o

## 2. Linker
It Links all the object files generated by the compiler properly and creates an executable file.
It resolves all the cross-file dependencies.
It throws a linker error if there is any linking issue between the files.
